# Election Rhino

This is a silly little project which takes data from [Democracy Club](https://www.democracyclub.org.uk) about (by default) the December 2019 general election and calculates the misrepresentation error between the system used to assign seats (First Past The Post) and the d'Hondt method, which is also not great but easy to code and use from the data we have.

Install and run using `npm`, where `npm run start` will compile and run the typescript.
